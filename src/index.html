          Howdy hey there, my name's Terra, nice to meet you! I'm a silly little
          self taught artist, writer and programmer. I generally use It/They/Fae
          but any pronouns are fine! Most of my art centers around my plethora
          of OCs, but I also occasionally create fanart of things I'm currently
          interested in! My favourite part of art is character design, which
          probably explains the sheer quantity of OCs in my possession.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am very sporadic when posting my art, so please be patient with me
          and my poor scheduling!
